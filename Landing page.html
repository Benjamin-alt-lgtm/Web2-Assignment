	<h1>IMMORTAL RISIING FIGHTERS</h1>

		<h3>World of Immortal Rising</h2>
		<p>"Immortal Rising 2" is a dark fantasy RPG game that builds on the success of its predecessor, "Immortal Rising," which soared to the top of South Korea's idle RPG game charts, amassing over 2 million downloads and generating $12 million in revenue in its first year. 

In this dark fantasy world, players take on the role of Immortals, ancient warriors resurrected to combat the Seven Demons threatening the world. Players, as Immortals, embark on epic quests to reclaim their realm's sanctity, forging alliances, battling demons, and bringing light back to shadowed lands..</p>

		<h3>Community Driven World</h2>
		<p>"Immortal Rising 2" empowers players with a player-centric approach to game design and governance. Players will have the opportunity to actively shape the game's direction and exercise their voting rights on game development policies. This decision-making process will be transparently facilitated through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Players can submit proposals on various aspects, which will be decided through voting, prompting the development studio to take action. The scope of these proposals can cover but are not confined to the following:<br>

1. Establishment and approval of the annual game development roadmap
<br>
2. Feedback and adjustments regarding growth/combat balancing
<br>
3. Proposals and approvals for the addition and consolidation of game servers</p>
